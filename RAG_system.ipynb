Я ссылался на элементы макета и скриншоты по номерам страниц файла.\\n\\nКлючевые рекомендации (общие)\\n- Единый стиль:\\n  - Используйте «Шаг 1/2/3…» вместо «Первый/Второй…».\\n  - Приведите к единому регистру заголовки: «Шаги», «Дополнительно», «Контакты».\\n  - Последовательно применяйте кавычки «…» и длинное тире —.\\n  - Пишите «учебный год 2025/2026, весенний семестр» (а не «год 2025–2026, семестр Весенний»).\\n  - «Google Таблицы» вместо «Google Таблица».\\n  - Уберите разговорные слова и местоимение «я» в гайде. Замените на нейтральный тон: «рекомендуется», «можно использовать».\\n- Точность терминов:\\n  - Поясните 1/60: «записано/максимум мест» (а не просто «количество зарегистрированных студентов»).\\n  - Слово «вакансии» может быть непонятно. Лучше «свободные слоты/потоки (без закреплённого преподавателя)».\\n  - Вместо «216а - аудитория» используйте «ауд. 216а».\\n  - «Код дисциплины (Code)» и «Наименование (Discipline)» — тяните терминологию из интерфейса.\\n- Читабельность и структура:\\n  - Добавьте мини-вступление: цель гайда, для кого, что будет по итогам.\\n  - На каждом шаге — одна ключевая мысль и короткие подписи к стрелкам на скриншотах.\\n  - Введите блок «Частые ошибки»/«Подсказки» (см. ниже).\\n- Визуальные правки (по страницам):\\n  - Стр. 1: Добавьте подзаголовок «Гайд по составлению расписания в Uninet (wsp.kbtu.kz)», версию и дату обновления.\\n  - Стр. 2: На скриншоте крупнее выделите «Расписание дисциплины» и путь в меню (если есть). Добавьте подпись под картинкой.\\n  - Стр. 3: Завершите первый абзац точкой; кратко подпишите стрелками поля «Code» и «Discipline». Укажите, что поиск по названию может вернуть несколько строк — проверять все.\\n  - Стр. 4: В блоке про «Год»/«Семестр» уточните «учебный год 2025/2026, весенний семестр». Стрелку на кнопку применения значений подпишите короче: «Применить год/семестр», затем «Фильтровать».\\n  - Стр. 5: Разбейте длинный блок «Дополнительно» на маркеры. Замените «тык*» на кликабельную ссылку или QR-код.\\n  - Стр. 6: Добавьте альтернативный контакт (почта/чат), дисклеймер «неофициальный гайд» и ссылку на Mentorship of SITE.\\n- Контентные дополнения:\\n  - Добавьте раздел «Если расписание не отображается»: сбросьте фильтры, проверьте выбранный год/семестр, попробуйте поиск по коду.\\n  - Уточните логику «связок» (лекция + практика): где в интерфейсе это видно и почему нельзя комбинировать произвольно.\\n  - Укажите, что одни и те же слоты могут повторяться по дням (пн/ср/пт) — как это распознать по таблице.\\n  - Дайте ссылку на «Финансовый кабинет» в Uninet и где его найти в меню.\\n  - При необходимости добавьте «Часть II»: как записываться на дисциплины, чтобы гайд был законченным циклом.\\n- Языковые правки (точечные):\\n  - «…и вашей задачей будет отфильтровать…» → «…вам нужно отфильтровать…»\\n  - «Можно искать и по одному, и по другому» → «Можно искать по любому из полей»\\n  - «Как видно из примера…» → «Обратите внимание: названия дисциплин могут дублироваться…»\\n  - «и новое для вас — (1/60)» → «показатель вида 1/60»\\n  - «Также, имейте в виду…» → «Также имейте в виду…»\\n  - «И вы только сможете…» → «Можно выбрать только допустимые пары…»\\n  - «вы выберете час» → «вы выберете время»\\n  - «проверьте финансовый кабинет, на наличие задолженностей» → «проверьте финансовый кабинет на наличие задолженностей»\\n\\nОтредактированная версия текста\\n— Титульная страница —\\nГайд по составлению расписания в Uninet (wsp.kbtu.kz)\\nДля студентов KBTU\\nMentorship of SITE\\nЧасть I\\nВерсия 1.0, обновлено: 2025-02-XX\\n\\nКратко о гайде\\nЦель: помочь студентам быстро находить и проверять расписание дисциплин в Uninet.\\nЧто понадобится: доступ к wsp.kbtu.kz (Uninet).\\nРезультат: вы сможете находить нужные дисциплины, правильно применять фильтры по учебному году и семестру и читать таблицу расписания без ошибок.\\n\\nШаги\\nШаг 1. Войдите в Uninet: wsp.kbtu.kz.\\nШаг 2. На главной странице выберите «Расписание дисциплины».\\nШаг 3. Найдите нужную дисциплину. Используйте код дисциплины (Code) или наименование (Discipline). Поиск по названию может вернуть несколько строк с разными преподавателями — проверьте все варианты.\\nШаг 4. Установите учебный год и семестр. Пример: учебный год 2025/2026, весенний семестр. Примените значения и нажмите «Фильтровать».\\nШаг 5. Изучите расписание. В таблице указаны преподаватели, дни и время. Обозначения: Л — лекция, П — практика, ауд. 216а — аудитория.

       " HumanMessage(content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Below are focused suggestions to improve clarity, consistency, and usefulness of the guide. They are grouped for quick application and include concrete microedits where relevant.\\n\\nOverall and structure\\n- Unify language and style: The document is largely in Russian but mixes English (“Mentorship of SITE”, PART I). Either:\\n  - Keep Russian throughout (Менторство факультета SITE, Часть I), or\\n  - Keep consistent bilingual headings (RU main, EN subtitle), but be consistent across pages.\\n- Add page numbers and a short table of contents for printed/PDF use.\\n- Keep step titles consistent: use “Шаг 1/2/3…” everywhere (in images on pages 2–4 they are “Первый шаг/Второй шаг/Третий шаг…”).\\n- Add a “Что в этой части” note on the title page (Часть I) and a pointer to Часть II (если планируется), to set user expectations.\\n\\nTitle page and metadata\\n- Title page: add version and updated date explicitly (now it’s present in the parsed text — keep it also on the visual title page on page 1).\\n- Make the URL clickable and canonical: https://wsp.kbtu.kz (not just wsp.kbtu.kz).\\n- Branding consistency: place “Mentorship of SITE” the same way on title and last page; consider adding a small logo only once to reduce visual noise.\\n\\nTerminology and accuracy\\n- System name: standardize to the official spelling used by the university interface (UniNet vs Uninet). If the UI uses “UniNet”, adopt that across the guide.\\n- Year/semester format: use one style consistently.\\n  - Either 2025/2026 (with slash) or 2025–2026 (en dash). If the interface shows 2025/2026, mirror the UI.\\n  - “весенний семестр” — in Russian, seasons are lowercase; if you capitalize for emphasis, do it consistently.\\n- Abbreviations legend: expand to cover all types used in UniNet.\\n  - Now: Л — лекция, П — практика. If the system uses Лаб/Сем/КП/КР etc., include them. If unsure, phrase as “Если в системе встречаются… — добавьте в легенду.”\\n\\nSearch and filtering (pages 3–4)\\n- Explicitly name UI controls as they appear in the system.\\n  - On page 4 you use “Нажмите эту кнопку, чтобы применить ‘Год’ и ‘Семестр’.” Replace with the exact label from the UI (e.g., “Применить/Apply”), so users can quickly find the control.\\n- Add microtips that save time:\\n  - Рекомендуется искать по коду дисциплины (Code) — это уменьшает число дублей.\\n  - Поиск по названию: проверьте, учитывает ли система регистр и язык ввода; при необходимости пробуйте русское/английское наименование.\\n  - Уточните, что дубли в списке дисциплин могут отличаться кафедрой, потоком или преподавателем; покажите, как это видно в таблице (подсветьте столбцы на скриншоте).\\n- Clarify filter workflow to prevent common mistakes:\\n  - “Сначала задайте Год и Семестр, нажмите ‘Применить’ (если кнопка есть), затем — ‘Фильтровать’.” Пользователи часто жмут только ‘Фильтровать’.\\n\\nРасшифровка строки расписания (page 4–5)\\n- Чётче объясните показатель 1/60:\\n  - Предложение: “1/60 — занято/максимум мест (сейчас записано 1 студент из 60).”\\n- Добавьте пояснение ключевых колонок:\\n  - Преподаватель; День; Время; Аудитория (ауд. 216а); Тип занятия (Л/П); Группа/поток (если отображается).\\n  - Если отображается кампус/корпус — упомяните.\\n\\nСвязки занятий и повторяемость (page 5)\\n- Связки: добавьте, как в системе определить допустимые пары лекция+практика.\\n  - Например: “Допустимые связки отображаются как …/видны в столбце …; выбирайте практику, которая относится к вашей лекции (один поток).”\\n- Повторяемость слотов:\\n  - Уточните, что одинаковое время часто повторяется по шаблону (пн/ср/пт или вт/чт).\\n  - Добавьте мини-совет: “При планировании в Google Таблицах используйте условное форматирование, чтобы подсветить пересечения по времени.”\\n\\nTroubleshooting (“Если расписание не отображается”)\\n- Расширьте раздел практическими шагами:\\n  - Обновите страницу с принудительной перезагрузкой (Ctrl/Cmd+F5).\\n  - Попробуйте другой браузер или режим инкогнито.\\n  - Проверьте, что выбран корректный учебный год/семестр и сняты лишние фильтры (кафедра/программа).\\n  - Если проблема сохраняется, обратитесь в IT-службу/деканат (добавьте актуальные контакты, если возможны).\\n- Отдельно упомяните частую ошибку: “Не нажали кнопку ‘Применить’ к фильтрам (если предусмотрена)”.\\n\\nПланирование и инструменты\\n- Google Таблицы:\\n  - Замените “Шаблон: [вставьте ссылку или QR]”/“тык*” (page 5) на реальную короткую ссылку и QR-код.\\n  - Добавьте инструкцию “Сделать копию” (Файл → Создать копию) и короткий гайд по цветовой схеме (Л — цвет А, П — цвет B).\\n  - Предложите альтернативу: экспорт в календарь (Google/ICS), если вы это практикуете. Если нет — пропустите.\\n- Приоритеты:\\n  - Добавьте критерии принятия решения: время, преподаватель, аудитория/корпус, интервалы между занятиями.\\n\\nФинансы и блокировки\\n- Уточните, почему это важно:\\n  - “Задолженности могут ограничивать запись на дисциплины/доступ к некоторым функциям.” Если не уверены, сформулируйте нейтрально: “могут повлиять на процесс записи”.\\n\\nКонтент и визуальные улучшения (pages 2–6)\\n- Скриншоты:\\n  - Добавьте краткие подписи под каждым скрином: “Где искать ‘Расписание дисциплины’” (page 2), “Пример поиска по Code/Discipline” (page 3), “Применение фильтров” (page 4), “Расшифровка таблицы” (page 4–5).\\n  - Стрелки/выделения: используйте единый стиль и цвет, подпишите точки клика точным названием кнопки.\\n  - Размывайте персональные данные (логин, ID), если они попадают в кадр.\\n- Дизайн:\\n  - Единые шрифты и отступы; уменьшите плотность текста на страницах 3–5 (разбейте длинные абзацы на пункты).\\n  - Добавьте визуальные “callout” блоки: Важно/Подсказка/Частая ошибка.\\n\\nЯзык и стилистика\\n- Императивная форма и короткие фразы повышают читабельность. Примеры микроисправлений:\\n  - Было: “Результат: вы сможете находить…”\\n    Стало: “Итог: вы быстро находите дисциплины, правильно применяете фильтры и без ошибок читаете таблицу.”\\n  - Было: “Выберите ‘Расписание дисциплины’…”\\n    Стало: “На главной странице выберите ‘Расписание дисциплины’.”\\n  - Было: “Например, по предмету казахский или русский…”\\n    Стало: “Например, для ‘Казахского языка’ или ‘Русского языка’.”\\n- Кавычки и тире: используйте «ёлочки» и длинное тире — по всему тексту, единообразно.\\n- Сокращения: “ауд.” используйте везде вместо “аудитория 216а”, или наоборот — но последовательно.\\n\\nЮридическое и контактное\\n- Дисклеймер: оставьте, но усилите практической пользой:\\n  - “Гайд неофициальный; интерфейс UniNet обновляется. Актуальные инструкции — на сайте/в ИТ-поддержке. Мы обновляем гайд по мере изменений.”\\n- Контакты (page 6): добавьте вторичный контакт (почта/группа поддержки/чат курса), часовой пояс ответа, а также ссылку на форму для обратной связи/ошибок в гайде.\\n- Версионирование: добавьте раздел “История изменений” (v1.0 — первичная публикация; v1.1 — уточнены фильтры и легенда и т. п.).\\n\\nДополнительные идеи (по желанию)\\n- Раздел “Частые вопросы”:\\n  - Почему вижу несколько одинаковых дисциплин?\\n  - Что означают коды групп?\\n  - Можно ли поменять практику, не меняя лекцию?\\n- Мини-глоссарий:\\n  - Код дисциплины (Code), Наименование (Discipline), Поток, Группа, Л/П, Ауд., Заполненность.\\n- Доступность:\\n  - Контрастные цвета на скриншотах; текстовые альтернативы для кнопок, если документ будет читаться с экранными дикторами.\\n\\nИтоговые точечные правки для включения сразу\\n- Везде: Uninet → UniNet (если так в интерфейсе).\\n- URL: заменить на https://wsp.kbtu.kz.\\n- Шаг 4: “Установите учебный год (например, 2025/2026) и семестр (весенний). Нажмите ‘Применить’, затем ‘Фильтровать’.”\\n- Легенда: “Л — лекция; П — практика; ауд. 216а — аудитория; 1/60 — занято/максимум мест.”\\n- Google Таблицы: заменить “тык*/[вставьте ссылку или QR]” на реальную короткую ссылку + QR.\\n- Страницы 2–4: заменить “Первый/Второй/Третий шаг” на “Шаг 1/2/3” для единообразия с текстом.\\n- Добавить раздел “Если расписание не отображается” с шагами: перезагрузка (Ctrl/Cmd+F5), инкогнито, другой браузер, сброс фильтров, проверка года/семестра, обращение в ИТ.\\n\\nЭти изменения сделают гайд более точным, единообразным и полезным как для первичного поиска дисциплин, так и для практического планирования расписания.'}], additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),\n",
       " HumanMessage(content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Here are focused, actionable suggestions to further improve the revised guide. I’ve grouped them by category and included concrete microcopy where helpful.\\n\\n1) Terminology and consistency\\n- UniNet naming: Use a single form throughout: “UniNet” (not Uninet/UNINET). Example: “Гайд по составлению расписания в UniNet (https://wsp.kbtu.kz)”.\\n- Language pairing: Decide whether UI labels are shown только на русском или в паре RU/EN. If bilingual, show both once on first use: «Расписание дисциплины (Schedule of disciplines)».\\n- Quotes and dashes: Use «…» for Russian quotes everywhere; use an en dash for ranges (2025–2026) and slash for academic year (2025/2026) consistently.\\n- Capitalization: Unify section titles in one style, e.g., Title Case for major sections (“Легенда и расшифровка”), sentence case for bullets.\\n- Abbreviations: Introduce once in legend and reuse consistently: Л (лекция), П (практика), “ауд.”. Avoid switching between “ауд. 216а” and “216а — аудитория”.\\n\\n2) Structure and navigation\\n- Scope in title: Clarify the scope of Part I. Example: “Часть I. Поиск и чтение расписания (без записи/регистрации)”.\\n- Table of contents: In PDF, add page numbers to the “Содержание” list and ensure anchors/bookmarks are set.\\n- Cross-references: Add “см. раздел …” links between “Шаги”, “Легенда”, и “Связки занятий”, e.g., в конце Шага 5: “См. также ‘Легенда’ и ‘Связки занятий’.”\\n\\n3) Accuracy with interface (avoid ambiguity)\\n- Exact button labels: Replace placeholders like “(если есть)” с проверенными подписями кнопок. Если кнопки “Применить” нет, удалите это упоминание и оставьте “Выберите Год/Семестр → Фильтровать”. Либо укажите две версии интерфейса: “Если видите кнопку ‘Применить’ — нажмите её, затем ‘Фильтровать’.”\\n- Field names: Закрепите точные заголовки столбцов интерфейса UniNet (RU/EN), например: Code, Discipline, Lecturer/Преподаватель, Day/День, Time/Время, Room/Аудитория, Type/Тип, Capacity/Заполненность, Group/Группа, Stream/Поток. Если каких‑то полей нет — не упоминать.\\n- Legend completeness: Проверьте, встречаются ли в UniNet “Лаб” (лабораторная), “Сем” (семинар), “Онлайн”, “Корпус/Кампус”, “Форма” (online/offline). Если да — добавьте в легенду с едиными сокращениями.\\n\\n4) Content clarifications\\n- “1/60” пояснение: Добавьте, что число динамическое и может обновляться с задержкой. Пример: “Показатель обновляется; обновите страницу при сомнении.”\\n- Дубликаты курсов: Ясно укажите причины дублей: разные кафедры/потоки/преподаватели/языки преподавания. Добавьте совет: “Сравнивайте столбцы Группа/Поток и Преподаватель.”\\n- Связки лекция+практика: Добавьте критерий совместимости (один и тот же поток/привязка в системе) и как это визуально понять (идентичный код потока/обозначение связки).\\n- Повторяемость слотов: Уточните, что расписание может показывать только один день из шаблона, а остальные дни совпадают по времени. Рекомендация: “Проверьте все дни недели в столбце День/Day перед финальным выбором.”\\n\\n5) Troubleshooting (расширить и сделать более практичным)\\n- Сброс и язык: Добавить шаги “Смените язык RU/EN и повторите поиск”, “Очистите фильтры кнопкой ‘Сбросить’ (Reset), затем задайте заново”.\\n- Кэш/расширения: Добавить “Отключите блокировщики/расширения для страницы” и “Очистите кэш и куки для домена kbtu.kz”.\\n- Часовой пояс/время: Кратко указать, что время отображается по времени кампуса (если это так) или посоветуйте сверять с локальным.\\n- Контакты поддержки: Вставьте конкретный адрес/телеграм-канал/Service Desk ссылку (плейсхолдер сейчас мешает действию).\\n\\n6) Planning and tools\\n- Шаблон таблицы: Замените плейсхолдер на реальную короткую ссылку + QR. Добавьте видимость: “доступ по ссылке: читатель/копирование разрешено”.\\n- Цветовая схема: Предложите палитру, дружелюбную к дальтонизму (например, с разной заливкой/штриховкой, а не только цветом).\\n- Проверка конфликтов: Добавьте инструкцию по формуле/условному форматированию для пересечений времени (например, сравнение интервалов).\\n\\n7) Visuals and screenshots\\n- Подписи и стрелки: Сохраните единый стиль (цвет, толщина, нумерация 1–2–3 на шаг). В подписях используйте точные названия пунктов меню/кнопок.\\n- Фокус на различиях: На скриншоте со списком дисциплин добавьте две выноски: “Одинаковое название — разные преподаватели” и “Одинаковое название — разные потоки/группы”.\\n- Легенда на скрине: На примере строки расписания визуально пометьте поля Л/П, Ауд., 1/60, Преподаватель, День/Время.\\n- Конфиденциальность: Добавьте явное правило: “Размывать ФИО студентов, ID, логины, email; оставлять только общедоступные данные о дисциплинах/преподавателях.”\\n\\n8) Editorial polish (микроулучшения)\\n- Вступление: Сократить и сделать ориентированным на действие. Например:\\n  Было: “Итог: вы быстро находите дисциплины, правильно применяете фильтры и без ошибок читаете таблицу расписания.”\\n  Стало: “Итог: вы находите дисциплины, корректно применяете фильтры и уверенно читаете таблицу расписания.”\\n- Шаги: Делать каждое действие отдельной фразой-командой. Пример для Шага 4:\\n  “Выберите учебный год (2025/2026) и семестр (Весенний). Нажмите ‘Применить’ (если отображается), затем ‘Фильтровать’.”\\n- Единые формы: “Для студентов KBTU” или “Для студентов КБТУ” — выберите один вариант и придерживайтесь его везде.\\n- Даты/версии: Укажите ISO-дату: “Версия 1.0 — 2025‑02‑14”. Добавьте владельца версии: “Ответственный редактор: …”.\\n\\n9) Accessibility and inclusivity\\n- Альт‑текст: Для PDF добавьте alt‑text к скриншотам (что изображено, какие элементы UI отмечены).\\n- Шрифты/контраст: Гарантируйте контраст не ниже WCAG AA. Минимальный кегль 11–12 pt для печати.\\n- Язык: Добавьте английскую краткую версию ключевых шагов (или дайте ссылку на EN‑версию гайда).\\n\\n10) Maintenance and governance\\n- История изменений: Добавьте ссылку на репозиторий/документ с историей (Changelog), укажите формат записи (дата, версия, суть правок).\\n- Обратная связь: Добавьте форму/опрос для фидбэка: “Нашли неточность? Заполните короткую форму: [ссылка].”\\n- SLA контактов: В “Контакты” укажите рабочие часы и среднее время ответа (например, “Пн–Пт 10:00–18:00, ответ в течение 24 ч”).\\n\\nПримеры точечных правок (готовые к замене)\\n- Заголовок: “Гайд по составлению расписания в UniNet (https://wsp.kbtu.kz) — Часть I”\\n- Блок “Что в этой части”:\\n  “Цель: быстро находить и проверять расписание дисциплин в UniNet.\\n   Необходимо: учётная запись KBTU и доступ к https://wsp.kbtu.kz.\\n   Результат: умеете искать дисциплины, применять фильтры (Год/Семестр) и читать строки расписания.”\\n- Легенда:\\n  “Тип: Л — лекция; П — практика.\\n   Аудитория: ‘ауд. 216а’.\\n   Заполненность: ‘1/60’ — записано/максимум мест.\\n   Колонки: Преподаватель; День; Время; Ауд.; Тип (Л/П); Группа/Поток; (при наличии) Кампус/Корпус, Формат (онлайн/офлайн).”\\n- Troubleshooting (добавить два пункта):\\n  “Отключите расширения (ad‑block, переводчики) для страницы и перезагрузите (Ctrl/Cmd+F5).\\n   Смените язык интерфейса RU/EN и повторите поиск по коду (Code).”\\n- Финансы:\\n  “Путь в UniNet: Меню → Финансовый кабинет → Задолженности.”\\n\\nИтог\\nТекущая редакция уже ясная и унифицированная. Ключевые улучшения — закрепить точные названия элементов интерфейса, убрать плейсхолдеры, усилить визуальную часть (подписи/легенды на скриншотах), добавить доступность (alt‑текст, контраст) и операционные детали (контакты, SLA, changelog, рабочие ссылки/QR). Это повысит точность, полезность и доверие к гайду.'}], additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]"
